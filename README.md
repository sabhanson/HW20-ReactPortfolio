# React Portfolio üìÅ [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

I built this portfolio using `React` so that employers can view my programming projects and contact me. I made it easy to navigate with mobile-first design. I have links to several of my coding applications for users to visit.
